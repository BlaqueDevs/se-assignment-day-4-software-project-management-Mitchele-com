2. Optimizing resource utilization and reducing waste.
3.Negotiating favourable terms with vendors andsuppliers.
4.Regularly reviewing and adjusting the budget as needed.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile 
Advantages.
Quick response to change .
Regular customer feedback.
Improved team collaboration.
Disadvantages.
Less predictably because it changes from time to time.
Requires significant customer involvement.
Waterfall.
Advantages.
Clear structures and documentation.
Easy to manage due to its rigidity 
Disadvantages .
Difficult to accomodate changes.
Testing occurs late in the process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile metodologies are generally a more beneficial in a project
Rapidly changing or unclear requirements.
The need for frequent customer feedback and collaboration.
Time sensitive or fast paced development cycle.
Waterfall methodologies are more often suitable for;
Projects with welldefined and stable requirements .
Highly regulatedor missing critical systems.
Environments where extensive planningand documentation are required. 
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
key methods for enssuring quality quality assurance in a software project include,
